# go-chirpy

This is the code for the boot.dev learn web server course. I followed through their guide to learn
the basics of building an API using Go.

It's a simple twitter clone that save state locally in a json file.

## Running the project

1. Clone the repo
2. Build and run the binary

```
go build && ./go-chirpy
```
